# Crypto Currency Dashboard
The submission zip folder contains two folders named Code and Executables. Their explanation is as follows:
1) Code Folder: Code folder contains 3 python editable code files. First python is named historicalfetch.py which when executed fethces top 500 crypto currencies from the web with all possible data and writes that data in the historical.csv file which has already daily historical data of top 500 currencies. 
Other file is cryptoHistoricalUpdate.py this file when executed asks user to tell if he wants single cuurency update or top 500 currency update. Further file is executed as expected.
Third file is named cryptoindicators.py this file when executed asks the user to enter one of the two options. whether to fetch one cuurency update or to bulk fetch indicators of top currencies. 
Note:  All these python files need python and pandas installed before execution. Furthermore, i used 3 free api's to fetch all data. So, speed of data fetch and quantity of data was less than we would have got if we would have used premium api's
1) Executable Folder:  This folder contains three executable files. They dont require any envirnment to be set or any software to be installed e.g python,pandas before execution. Every required package is pre installed in them.
